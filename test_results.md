# Wildfire Risk Prediction API Integration Test Results

## Test Case 1: Basic API Connection
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: Successfully sent request to backend API and received proper response with risk assessment data.
- **API Response**: Now includes detailed risk levels (Low, Moderate, High, Very High, Extreme) with appropriate risk scores that vary based on input conditions.

## Test Case 2: Map Selection and Weather Data
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: Successfully selected locations on the map and retrieved weather data.
- **Observation**: The Weather Info component correctly displays the retrieved weather data.

## Test Case 3: Frontend-to-Backend Prediction Flow
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: Successfully sent prediction requests from the frontend to the backend API.
- **Observation**: API status notifications correctly show loading and success states, and the risk assessment is displayed with detailed factor contributions.

## Test Case 4: Error Handling
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: When backend is unavailable, the frontend gracefully falls back to client-side prediction.
- **Observation**: Error notifications are displayed correctly, and client-side prediction provides a fallback result.

## Test Case 5: Input Validation
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: The API now properly responds to different input scenarios with appropriately varied risk levels.
- **Observation**: Test scenarios now result in distinct risk levels:
  - Low Risk Scenario → Moderate (26%)
  - Medium Risk Scenario → High (46%)
  - High Risk Scenario → Very High (76%)
  - Extreme Values → Extreme (97%)

## Additional Improvements
1. **Detailed Factor Contributions**: The API now returns detailed contribution values for each risk factor
2. **Model Details**: Response includes information about the prediction source and comparison between original and adjusted scores
3. **Enhanced Visualization**: Frontend now displays factor contribution bars to help users understand what's driving the risk level
4. **Improved Risk Levels**: Using a 5-level scale (Low, Moderate, High, Very High, Extreme) instead of the previous 3-level scale

## Summary
- Successfully integrated the frontend with the backend API
- Fixed the issue with model predictions being too similar regardless of input conditions
- Enhanced the response with detailed factor contributions and model information
- Improved the frontend visualization to show what factors contribute most to risk
- Implemented a more granular risk level scale for better decision-making

## Next Steps
1. Consider collecting actual prediction outcomes to further improve the model
2. Add user feedback mechanism to refine risk assessments
3. Implement caching of prediction results for similar locations and conditions
4. Add more detailed regional data that might affect wildfire risk
