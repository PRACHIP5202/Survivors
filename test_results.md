# Wildfire Risk Prediction API Integration Test Results

## Test Case 1: Basic API Connection
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: Successfully sent request to backend API and received proper response with risk assessment data.
- **API Response**: Included risk_level: "High", risk_score: ~0.51, confidence: 0.6, and appropriate recommendations.

## Test Case 2: Map Selection and Weather Data
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: Successfully selected locations on the map and retrieved weather data.
- **Observation**: The Weather Info component correctly displays the retrieved weather data.

## Test Case 3: Frontend-to-Backend Prediction Flow
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: Successfully sent prediction requests from the frontend to the backend API.
- **Observation**: API status notifications correctly show loading and success states, and the risk assessment is displayed.

## Test Case 4: Error Handling
- **Status**: PASS
- **Notes**: When backend is unavailable, the frontend gracefully falls back to client-side prediction.
- **Observation**: Error notifications are displayed correctly, and client-side prediction provides a fallback result.

## Test Case 5: Input Validation
- **Status**: PARTIAL
- **Notes**: The API accepts and processes extreme values, but there's room for improvement in providing more varied risk levels.
- **Observation**: All test scenarios resulted in a "High" risk level despite varying input conditions, suggesting the model might need calibration.

## Additional Test: Multiple Risk Scenarios
- We tested multiple scenarios with varying input values (low, medium, high, extreme)
- All scenarios resulted in similar risk scores (around 0.50-0.51) and the same "High" risk level
- The API response time was consistent (approximately 100-250ms)

## Summary
- Successfully integrated the frontend with the backend API
- The API correctly processes input data and provides risk assessments
- CORS is properly configured to allow cross-origin requests
- Error handling is implemented effectively
- Future work should focus on model calibration to provide more varied risk levels based on input conditions

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why the model returns similar risk scores for different input scenarios
2. Improve the model to better differentiate between low, medium, and high-risk conditions
3. Add more comprehensive client-side input validation
4. Consider adding a loading state indicator during API requests
5. Expand the recommendations based on specific input values
